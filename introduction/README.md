# Introduction

## Example Distributions

This file contains examples of statistical distributions/functions avaliable in base R.
I have also coded up manual version of several myself.

I also introduce a simulation of exponential random variables, and consider fitting a distribution to this

## Genomic Statistics

An exercise in data input and analysis, I take a .txt file of bases (an example of the E coli sequence is also
provided in Ecoli.txt) and analysis base frequencies to determine patterns here.

This uses data from the completely sequenced genome of E. coli, more precisely strain K-12, substrain MG 1655, version M52 short.
